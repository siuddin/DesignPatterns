Description  when to apply Observer  design Pattern


It's not a common situation but there are cases when a there are many observers that need to observe more than one subject.
 In this case the observer need to be notified not only about the change, 
but also which is the subject with the state changed. 
This can be realized very simple by adding to the subjects reference in the update notification method. 
The subject will pass a reference to itself(this) to the when notify the observer.
